In this lab, I built on the last html webpage I made for lab1. In task I, I created forms in HTML and incorporated javascript with inline, same-site file, and remote javascript files.
In task 2, I added Ajax, CSS, and jQuery to my Html page. I then used jQuery to demonstrate GET and POST requests. I finally incorporated WEB API integration with javascript and jQuery and fetch() for the input user agify API.

### Task 1: Basic HTML with forms, and JavaScript
