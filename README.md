## Overview
Webpage: [https://elsy14.github.io/waph.html](https://elsy14.github.io/waph.html)

Repository: [https://github.com/Elsy14/Elsy14.github.io/tree/main](https://github.com/Elsy14/Elsy14.github.io/tree/main)

In this individual project, I implemented some front-end development concepts I have learned so far into a professional website showcasing my resume, course, and development concepts.

### General Requirements

#### Deploy site
To deploy my site I first created a new public repository with the same username and github.io at the end. I then added my HTML page and used that to ensure my HTML page is displayed in the GitHub cloud and accessible in any browser.

#### Content
-I used the email js to display my email and added my LinkedIn link
-I used HTML descriptive listing with tiered sections using the tags dd and dl to display my resume
-I used HTML unordered listing using the tags ul and li to display the contents of the course 

### Non-technical requirements

#### Open Source CSS 
-used an open-source bootstrap to implement CSS

#### Page Tracker
-Using the [https://flagcounter.com]/(https://flagcounter.com/) I customized a mini flag counter to count the number of times my page has been viewed. I was given the HTML link to place on my page.

### Technical Requirements

#### JQuery and JavaScript Code -still finish
-I used the inline javascript in HTML to show my email using the external email.js file. This is located in my contact information section
-I used an inline script to demonstrate the digital clock
-I used a remote javascript file - clock.js display the analog clock


#### Web API
-I navigated to [jQuery CDN(https://releases.jquery.com/) and used the script code to use the jQuery library. I added the code at the beginning of my HTML page
-I then used Ajax, Fetch, and Promise to demonstrate programming jokes every minute 
-I finally used a third-party WEB API to display the weather from [weather.io](www.weatherbit.io) and integrated it into my HTML

#### Java Script cookies
I used JavaScript to implement set, session start, and display cookies by displaying the welcome message for first-time visitors, and the previous visit time to returning visitors of my webpage.
